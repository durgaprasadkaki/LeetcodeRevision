Hint
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target.
 There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does 
not exist, return the first character in letters.

 

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
Example 2:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.*/
